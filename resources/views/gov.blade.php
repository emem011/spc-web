Hacienda Escudero Plantation Resort Town is the largest planned community investment in the city covering 415 hectares. The resort has the richness of cocunut plantation, and provides serenading Filipino songs and Bayanihan Dances (Folk Dances).

Public Playground and Sampalok Lake (Katuparan ng Pangarap: Fulfillment of Dreams) is a public playground in the city built during the term of mayor Atty. Zacarias Africa Ticzon, who as well improved tourism places around Lake Sampaloc, that is near the municipal City Hall. Both places serve as haven for sports, and recreation. The vicinity for tourism consequently encouraged small businesses for restaurants of native dishes catering visitors of the area. It has dramatically contributed income for the city.

Business, commerce, and industry
At the end of the 20th century and the start of the 21st century, economic development shifted from San Pablo to the western Laguna. San Pedro, Biñan City, Santa Rosa City, Cabuyao City, Calamba City, Los Baños, and Santa Cruz experienced rapid economic development brought about by local and foreign investments, the rapid growth of industrial estates and export processing zones, and the placement of major institutions in those areas, San Pablo City was left behind and remained a semi-developed residential community.
Despite the fact that the city was partly touched by economic development, San Pablo City boasts itself as a potential eco-tourism destination in the province. However, given its human and land resources, various BPO companies are seriously looking at developing the city into the ICT hub of Southern Luzon. Although there were previous attempts to build a similar establishment, SM Prime Holdings was given its go signal in July 2008 to push ahead for SM City San Pablo located at Riverina Commercial Estates along Maharlika Highway at Brgy San Rafael.
Apart from this, the development of the Hacienda Escudero plantation resort town and nearby real estates, which is a joint venture with Landco, is by far the largest planned community investment in the city covering 415 hectares:It will include resort type communities; the original Villa Escudero Plantations as the center-piece; commercial establishments like a mall, hotels, and a convention center to be built relative to the distinctive architecture theme of the original Villa Escudero. As such Hacienda Escudero will become the ultimate history town themed community in this part of the country.
n April 2017, Sannera San Pablo, another real estate development was started by Ovialand Incorporated. The project is a 5.4 hectares in total area, situated in Brgy. San Antonio II, San Pablo City along Maharlika highway.

ABS-CBN San Pablo Channel 46 is serving the city through its office along Rizal Avenue at the heart of the city.

San Pablo City is home to showrooms, marketing, and parts/servicing centers of Honda Cars Laguna; Ford San Pablo; Isuzu San Pablo; Hyundai San Pablo; Mitsubishi (SFM) San Pablo; Nissan Southwoods-San Pablo; and Toyota San Pablo.

San Pablo also claims the title City of Buko Pie - Buko Pie", which is a disputed title as other neighboring towns are also known for producing the delicacy. "Colettes' Buko Pie", based in San Pablo, was known for experimenting with different variants of the delicacy, though the first buko pie store is in Los Baños, "D' Original Buko Pie" store. Buko pie is acknowledged to have originated from Los Baños - University of the Philippines - Los Banos, as an invention of a Food Technologist from UPLB - University of the Philippines, Los Banos Campus. Thus, the more popular term: "Los Baños Buko Pie." The supply of coconut in San Pablo, though, makes it an ideal spot for putting up buko pie shops.

Franklin Baker Company, one of the well-known companies with operations in San Pablo City, has announced that its plant in San Pablo City will cease its operations and transfer to another existing facility, owned by the said company, in Davao del Sur by December 2008. The said decision could affect the jobs of at least 1,200 people, the majority of them San Pableños. Various factors are blamed for this closure, including the conversion of big coconut farms into residential areas.[10] However, production was restored in the first quarter of 2009 in the San Pablo plant of Franklin Baker Company due to processing problems encountered at Davao del Sur.</p>
